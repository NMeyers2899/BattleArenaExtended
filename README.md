# BattleArenaExtended
## How to Play
**Battle Arena Extended** is a Rougelike RPG where you battle monsters, enter shops, and try to beat the dangerous World Eater. As the player, you will battle through hordes of enemies and deadly bosses in order to reach your goal. But a lonely player is not enough to stop a threat like the World Eater, so delve into shops and buy powerful items using the gold you've accquired. You are not expected to win your first try, but learn from your mistakes and emerge victorious against the threat before you!

You are able to equip two items to your player, one of an Attack type and one of a Defense type. So far you will not be able to see what is currently equipped, except seeing how they affect your stats. When in shops, it is a rule that higher costs means higher stats.
## How to Install
Download the most current release of the game, and unzip the file that was just downloaded. From there, open the unzipped file and find the application labeled **BattleArenaExtended.exe** and open it up to play the game!
## Know Bugs
When you load a previous save, the items you had equipped will not be equipped upon loading.
